Title: 
Transfer Learning in Reinforcement Learning for Agricultural Decision Support in Polyculture Systems using FarmGym

Description: 
This study investigates the performance of Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agents in decision support for agricultural settings, ranging from simple monoculture environments to a more complex polyculture system. Specifically, the research evaluates the performance of these reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in managing farms with single crop types (beans and corn) and a polyculture farm (beans, corn, and tomatoes). A critical aspect of this study is examining the efficacy of transfer learning, where agents pretrained in monoculture settings are deployed in different monoculture environments or a polyculture environment. By comparing baseline performances and assessing the impact of transfer learning, this research aims to shed light on the efficiency of DQN and PPO agents in different agricultural scenarios, contributing to the development of more intelligent and sustainable farming practices through advanced AI methodologies.
